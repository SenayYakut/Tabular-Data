# Tabular Data

There are many websites on the Internet that display information like stock prices, sports scores, invoice data, and more. This data is naturally tabular in nature, meaning that a table is often the best way of presenting the data.

In this pROJECT, Iâ€™ll use the HTML <table> element to present information in a two-dimensional table to the users.

## Installation


```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
