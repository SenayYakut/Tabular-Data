# Tabular Data

Tabular Data is a HTML5, CSS3 project

There are many websites on the Internet that display information like stock prices, sports scores, invoice data, and more. This data is naturally tabular in nature, meaning that a table is often the best way of presenting the data.

In this pROJECT, Iâ€™ll use the HTML <table> element to present information in a two-dimensional table to the users.
